"""
Program: Continuous List Input
------------------------------
This program continuously asks the user to input values
and adds them to a list. The process stops when the user
presses enter without typing anything, and the program
then prints the final list.

        # Step 3: Check if the user pressed enter without typing
        if value == "":
            break  # Exit the loop

        # Step 4: Add the value to the list
        values_list.append(value)

    # Step 5: Print the final list
